    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Many years ago, I attended an ICS chili cook -off at the Kipona Festival in Harrisburg, PA. I found it very fascinating, and it appeared the cooks, as well as the tasters, were all having a hoot! Being the competitive type, I decided to join in on the fun. So, the following year a friend and I created a stand known as 'Willie's Old-Fashioned Hillbilly Chili' and concocted some version of what should have never been called chili…. and we had a blast! Thirty years later, and a team name change to Dire Wolf Chili, I'm still competing and enjoying the ride. So, once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places, if you look at it right! </p>
